# Repair Rover

Repair Rover is a 6-wheel drive truck designed for road maintenance and cleaning using Arduino and various sensors. The rover autonomously detects and repairs road imperfections such as dig-ins and cleans debris using built-in mechanisms.

## Features

### 1. Ground Clearance Measurement

Repair Rover uses an ultrasonic sensor to continuously measure the ground clearance beneath it. This allows it to detect variations in road surface height, indicating areas that need repair.

### 2. Flapper Mechanism

To repair dig-ins and uneven surfaces, Repair Rover is equipped with a flapper mechanism at the back. The flapper dispenses a mixture designed to fill and smooth out road imperfections. It is controlled by a servo motor, which opens and closes the flapper as needed.

### 3. Obstacle Detection and Cleaning

In addition to road repair, the rover detects obstacles in its path using the same ultrasonic sensor. When an obstacle is detected, Repair Rover activates a vacuum cleaner and brush mechanism. This efficiently cleans debris and other obstructions from the road, ensuring smooth passage.

### 4. Autonomous Operation

Repair Rover operates autonomously, making real-time decisions based on sensor feedback. It navigates its environment, identifies areas for repair, and performs cleaning tasks without human intervention.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Board:** Manages sensor inputs and controls the rover's operations.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Measures ground clearance and detects obstacles.
- **Servo Motor:** Controls the flapper mechanism for road repair.
- **Vacuum Cleaner and Brush:** Cleans debris and obstacles from the road surface.

## How It Works

Repair Rover functions by continuously scanning the road surface with its ultrasonic sensor. When a decrease in ground clearance is detected, indicating a dig-in, the rover positions its flapper over the affected area. The servo motor opens the flapper, releasing the repair mixture until the ground is level again. If an obstacle is detected, the vacuum cleaner and brush activate to clear the road surface.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Navigation:** Implement GPS or more advanced navigation sensors for precise location awareness.
- **Improved Efficiency:** Optimize the flapper mechanism for faster and more efficient repair operations.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Integrate IoT capabilities for remote monitoring and control of Repair Rover's operations.
